sword and spear
wall of shields
standing strong
on this their chosen battle field

form the lines
shield by shield



------
Oh how happy
 I was there
There ....

=======================

I stand alone in the darkness
The winter of my life came so fast
Memories go back to childhood
To days I still recall

[Chorus]
I'm still there, everywhere
I'm the dust in the wind
I'm the star in the northern sky
